    <h2>NICE - Jr. Software Developer</h2>

    <p><strong>Online Assessment:</strong><br/>
    The test included Aptitude, Reasoning, and 3 Coding Questions:<br/>
    - 2 questions could be solved in any language (C, C++, Python, Java)<br/>
    - 1 question was mandatory in Java<br/>
    After shortlisting, selected candidates were called to the office for interviews.</p>

    <p><strong>Technical Interview:</strong><br/>
    The interview focused heavily on Java concepts since I had mentioned it in my resume. Questions included:<br/>
    - Java Memory Management<br/>
    - Difference between <code>String</code>, <code>StringBuffer</code>, and <code>StringBuilder</code> with code (written on paper)<br/>
    - <code>HashMap</code> usage and how memory is managed in it<br/>
    - Object-Oriented Programming concepts<br/>
    - DBMS: If primary key exists, why indexing is needed?<br/>
    - One puzzle was asked (involving 3 buckets of 3L, 4L, and 5L - not fully recalled)<br/>
    Also asked: My hobbies and weaknesses.<br/><br/>
    <em>Tip:</em> If you can't answer a question, say positively: “Right now I can't recall, but I’ll definitely read about it after this.” It shows you’re willing to learn.</p>

    <p><strong>Managerial Interview:</strong><br/>
    Lasted around 50 minutes. It began with a detailed introduction:<br/>
    - Family background, schooling, etc.<br/>
    - In-depth discussion on the projects mentioned in my resume<br/>
    - Asked about my virtual internship at NICE, the project, and tech stack used<br/>
    <em>This round tested my behavior, thought process, and attitude towards problem-solving.</em></p>

    <p><strong>HR Interview:</strong><br/>
    A short round (15–20 mins). Questions included:<br/>
    - Brief introduction and background<br/>
    - Why I want to join NICE<br/>
    - Hobbies and how I pursue them daily<br/>
    - “What will you do with your first salary?”<br/><br/>
    <em>Overall Insight:</em> It’s not just about technical knowledge, but also your attitude, problem-solving approach, mindset, and learning willingness. Stay calm and don’t give up!</p>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong><br/>
    <span style="color: #00e0ff; font-weight: bold;">Selected</span> at NICE as Jr. Software Developer.</p>
