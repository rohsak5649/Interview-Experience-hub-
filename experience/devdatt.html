    <h2>Mindsprint - SAP Developer Role</h2>

    <p><strong>Round - Technical + Role Fit Interview:</strong><br/>
    The interview started with a personal introduction. After that, I was asked about the projects listed in my resume. I had to choose one project and explain its complete timeline — from how the idea originated to its deployment and the social impact it created.</p>

    <p>Then the interviewer asked me about the role I will be assigned after joining Mindsprint. He wanted to know if I had any prior knowledge of the SAP Developer role and how I would fit into it. I explained how my background and interests align with the position.</p>

    <p>Later, I was given a scenario where I had to interact with a client regarding a project. The interviewer asked how I would manage communication and handle the client professionally. I answered with a structured approach to ensure clarity, timely updates, and requirement understanding.</p>

    <p>Finally, I was given a chance to ask questions. I asked one insightful question to the interviewer, which was well received. The interview concluded on a positive note.</p>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong><br/>
    <span style="color: #00e0ff; font-weight: bold;">Selected</span> as SAP Developer at Mindsprint through college placement.</p>
